    This brief is to design and build a website for Doggie walks. In order to complete
     this the first stage was to complete a requirements table to follow before
     completing any designing phase. The requirements enabled all the information to be
     presented to be used in order to design from the clients requirements. The
     requirements shows all the aspects which are to be incorporated into the build,

      <h2>Build in html and css</h2>
      <p>
        The design phase established exactly what is required in the build and provides
        a template from which to follow in the building of the website in html and css.
        By doing a thorough design makes the build phase much easier because it only has to
        follow the design laid out.
        The built website can be accessed: https://happy-bartik-db9164.netlify.app
