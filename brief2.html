    This brief is to design and build a website for Doggie walks. In order to complete
     this the first stage was to complete a requirements table to follow before
     completing any designing phase. The requirements enabled all the information to be
     presented to be used in order to design from the clients requirements. The
     requirements shows all the aspects which are to be incorporated into the build,
      to ensure the project stays in line with what the client requires. </p>
      <h2>Designs on Axure</h2>
      <p>
        Before being using the Axure program, I had to complete a course on linked in
        learning. I had already learned how to use figma, and so wanted to learn a new
        software to use. I found this software much better than figma, in terms of the
        way it allowed me to make notes on the pages, and found the overall ease of use
        on the site to be better and more efficient when designing a website prototype

      <h2>Build in html and css</h2>
      <p>
        The design phase established exactly what is required in the build and provides
        a template from which to follow in the building of the website in html and css.
        By doing a thorough design makes the build phase much easier because it only has to
        follow the design laid out.
